prog environment
--- websorm with basic plugins and tabnine suggestions (AI)
--- eslint to check for standards

Backend enironment
--- install backend dependencies
--- spin off a simple express server
--- I decided on using knex with sqlite but initializing knex environmentt with knex-cli for migrations
--- and added a migrate command to re-create the database as it is

Thought process (12: 54)
---- Being mindful of time constrainst, I need to be a ble to create a
working backend that should be able to implement a player
and connect it to the frontend

---- also create the leaderboard logic which looks simple to acieve within timeframe

// quickly spin off authentication with passport sample guide

##########################  BATTLE IDEA #########################
[(:-) if it makes any sense ]
// many players are involved in a battle
// since attacking player specify who they wish to attack
// selected player to be attacked will have a role opponent set to active
// battle implements an attack logic that checks for attack power and attack turn(active or not)
// attack can be thougt of as an interface contract action (though abstraction no possible in JS)
// probably implement it as some function logic

---> Game ----> (Battle(s))  -----> ({ battle 1: players: [ {} ] , turn: '', turn_action: ''}



Final notes: Time is almost up: I will add some code to the front
